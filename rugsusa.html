                        <p class="work_box-text-para">Rugs USA is an ecommerce store primarily focused on selling high quality rugs at the best prices. Rugs USA provides a wide range and variety of sizes, designs, weaves fit for any customer. They also have a huge set of lightings and lamps to complement their rugs. </p>

                        <h2 class="work_box-text-header">Problems</h2>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">Recognizing that ecommerce was growing exponentially, there was a need to update the overall look of the Rugs USA platform to bring it up to date. Rugs USA was a simple red and white website with no separation of sections and no quality of life features to make it easy for the user to use and navigate.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">In regards to the main rugs catalog page, the flaws that I saw were a lack of good previews and options for each rug. Customers would have to click into a rug to see the variation of sizes and colors. And when users clicked into a rug for a full view, there was a lack of useful information, links, and structure for such an important page.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">Another huge issue with the Rugs USA store was the amount of customers abandoning their cart and leaving the website before completing their purchases. After having multiple discussions between the design, engineering, and analytics team, it was determined that the main reason customers left pre-purchase was due to not enough information per rug and not knowing how the rug would fit in their rooms.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">The audience that Rugs USA caters to is primarily the middle-class buyers who want a great quality rug without having to break their wallets. It is crucial to keep in mind that there are experienced rug buyers and buyers who have not purchased a single rug before. I made sure to keep both users in mind while designing.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">At Rugs USA, I worked primarily as a front end web developer and designer. I was mainly assigned to the engineering team to help implement, fix, or update new features. I also worked very closely with the design team because I was tasked with new designs and mockups for websites, banners, event advertisements, and logo designs. It helped to be involved in both the engineering and design process to get a full view of what and how we were going to implement upcoming features. I was also in frequent communication with the sales and analytics team to receive user information regarding user activity, which I used to create a better overall user experience.</p>

                    <div class="work_box-text">
                        <h2 class="work_box-text-header">Rugs Catalog</h2>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">My main focus was to redesign the main rugs catalog page and create a way to provide as much useful information as possible without overloading. I first started off with the overall design of the website and how to make a better viewing experience for customers.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">There was an overwhelming amount of filters with no separation or categories, which can result in a large amount of scrolling and searching. I condensed each filter with its own category and subcategories to make it easier for the user to find the filter they’re looking for. I moved the location of the filter to the top of the rugs list instead of the side to provide more view space for the main content, the rugs.</p>
                        <div class="work_box" style="width:100%">
                            <img src="images/rugsusa/rugsusa_catalog1.png" class="work_box-img">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">Each rug comes with its own variations and so I added a way to preview each of the colors. Reviews are crucial to a customer, especially online as evident from Amazon and Yelp. Reviews itself can decide whether a customer buys it or avoids it, and so I put the review under the name of the rug. In a time of quick deliveries and mass shipments, the importance of adding “Fast & Free Shipping” to the preview was an easy way of answering every customer’s worry about shipment time and price.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">When users clicked into a rug for a full view, there was a lack of useful information and structure. I included all the information on the catalog preview but with extra information that could help the user just a bit more. For the main information that Rugs USA provides, I included a sale timer, every color of the rug, each shape that the rug can be made into, every sizing with their prices and sale prices, and shipment estimation. There are other useful links such as “You might also like” and “Your recently viewed” to provide a quick way to access other recommendations and previously interested rugs.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">Since reviews and other customer experiences are so crucial when purchasing products, I included a section for reviews, questions and answers (asked by the customers and answered by Rugs USA team members), and customer photos. This covers almost every option that customers might have questions or concerns about regarding their purchase.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">For the issue of cart abandonment, I began a solo project called Rugs 101. Rugs 101 is a complete buyer’s guide for new and existing customers who have questions or are unsure about their purchase. Rugs 101 would feature information regarding:</p>
                        <ol class="rugslist">
                            <li class="rugslist_li">Rug Size</li>
                            <li class="rugslist_li">Weave and Materials</li>
                            <li class="rugslist_li">Washing instructions</li>
                            <li class="rugslist_li">Room Dimensions</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">These were the main questions and concerns that users have given through feedback, and so I decided to create a section and guide for each of them. Each section goes over in full detail of their respective topic. Every section has their own set of images and graphics that help visualize each piece of information (such as room dimensions and rug sizes, materials, and colors). After receiving analytics and feedback, we received a lot of activity and views on our Rugs 101 guide in conjunction with rug purchases, decreasing overall cart abandonment by 23%.</p>

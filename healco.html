It allows users to easily enlist their properties while using a matching system to connect lessors with the perfect lessee and vice versa. HealCo also has a huge focus on telemedicine - a way for patients to get medical assistance through digital and long distance means. HealCo is the Airbnb of medical office space and ambulatory surgery centers - and now the only official Health System Without Walls (HSWOW).</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">One of the main reasons I was brought into HealCo was to redesign the entire user interface and user experience for their website, dashboard, and form flows. As HealCo was still a relatively new company, most of their tasks were focused on the completion of its core features. This left the design at a bare minimum. I organized the sections by order of importance and began my redesigns. One thing I had to keep in mind was scalability, as HealCo was still rapidly rolling out new features for its users.</p>

                            <li class="rugslist_li"><span class="black">Website</span>: Being relatively new, HealCo received its users through connection in the medical field and word of mouth. Due to that, its users already knew what HealCo provided without having to look through the website for information. However, this creates a lack of information for completely new users who find HealCo through other means.</li>

                            <li class="rugslist_li"><span class="black">Form Flows</span>: When users began the sign up process, we found out that users were leaving mid process due to specific questions. Some were unanswerable or frustrating to answer, but was required.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li class="rugslist_li"><span class="black">Dashboard</span>: As more features are added to the dashboard, there was a severe lack of direction and smooth navigation for users. Users have said it was difficult to navigate and required many clicks to reach their destination. This was apparent in both the dashboard’s design and its navigation system. Options were too deeply hidden without a quick and simple way to be led to the source of information.</li>

I was mainly assigned to the engineering team to help implement, fix, and update new features. I worked very closely with both the design team and analytics team to get a full understanding of what needs changes based on user activity. With the design team, I created new designs and mockups for websites, banners, event advertisements, and logo designs. It helped to be involved in both the engineering and design process to get a full view of what and how we were going to implement upcoming features. I also kept close contact with the sales and analytics team to receive user information regarding user activity, which I used in conjunction with the other information from both the engineering and design team.</p>

Users felt lost and frustrated when asked such specific questions before they could even get to the dashboard to see what HealCo had to offer.

I realized the lack of connections and links between information, making the user go through the entire dashboard to find the correlation information. I included many necessary hyperlinks for users to click if they wanted more information. I also added a visual of progression so users knew how they were doing in the current flow they were in. One thing I focused on was creating a sense of flow between each feature for the users to follow through. This helped users complete each step without being lost on what they’re required to do next.

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">With the lack of necessary information and clear sense of division between different options, it gave users a confusing and frustrating user experience from start to finish. Showing a clear indication of the users category made them know they were going through the process correctly. The new form flows prevented users from leaving mid sign up because of unnecessarily complicated requests. With the new FTUE, it guided new users through their personalized dashboard which helps users use their features to the fullest. And finally with the new dashboard, it was easier than ever for users to navigate their dashboard. This smooth experience from start to finish gives users confidence in themselves and the platform that they’re using.

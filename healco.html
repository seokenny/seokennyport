                        <p class="work_box-text-para">HealCo is a web platform made for medical hosts and guests to lease or rent a space based on their specialties. It allows users to easily enlist their properties while using a matching system to connect lessors with the perfect lessee and vice versa. HealCo also has a huge focus on telemedicine - a way for patients to get medical assistance through digital and long distance means. HealCo is the Airbnb of medical office space and ambulatory surgery centers - and now the only official Health System Without Walls (HSWOW).</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">One of the main reasons I was brought into HealCo was to redesign the entire user interface and user experience for their website, dashboard, and form flows. As HealCo was still a relatively new company, most of their tasks were focused on the completion of its core features. This left the design at a bare minimum. I organized the sections by order of importance and began my redesigns. One thing I had to keep in mind was scalability, as HealCo was still rapidly rolling out new features for its users.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">I laid out the goals that I needed to fulfill based on user flow direction:</p>
                        <ol class="rugslist">
                            <li class="rugslist_li"><span class="black">Website</span>: Being relatively new, HealCo received its users through connection in the medical field and word of mouth. Due to that, its users already knew what HealCo provided without having to look through the website for information. However, this creates a lack of information for completely new users who find HealCo through other means.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li class="rugslist_li"><span class="black">Form Flows</span>: At the time of my employment, there were only two options for users: Lessee and Lessor. But as the user base increased and telemedicine became a huge feature in HealCo, there was a need to add more categories for users to identify. As a result, users were confused whether they had signed up correctly at the end of the sign up flows. The form needed a more precise division to indicate the user’s choice. </li>
                            <br>
                            <li class="rugslist_li"><span class="black">Dashboard</span>: As more features are added to the dashboard, there was a severe lack of direction and smooth navigation for users. Users have said it was difficult to navigate and required many clicks to reach their destination. This was apparent in both the dashboard’s design and its navigation system. Options were too deeply hidden without a quick and simple way to be led to the source of information.</li>

Hosts are the users that own the location and are looking for Guests to rent the space. Guests look for locations that are available and rent out the space under the Hosts. This also applies to the virtual side of sharing medical space - telemedicine. HealCo’s users are doctors and medical clinics that are looking for other related professionals to fill any available spaces in their medically approved offices.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">There were a large amount of issues that were received from user feedback regarding the entire sign up process. I broke down the issues into sections and in the order of importance based on user feedback: </p>

                            <li class="rugslist_li">The main and biggest complaint was the amount of information required to finish signing up. Some of the questions were too specific, unknown or annoying for users to receive immediately, such as room dimensions in square feet, budgeting, and staff / room information. Users felt lost and frustrated when asked such specific questions before they could even get to the dashboard to see what HealCo had to offer. This led to some users leaving the form mid-way through the process.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li class="rugslist_li">Although HealCo has two main categories - Hosts and Guests - there were subcategories including Virtual Hosts and Virtual Guests which followed a different set of information required. In addition, HealCo added the option for ASC (Ambulatory Surgery Centers) in response to COVID-19, which was its own subcategory of Hosts. This caused problems for users when they didn’t have clear indications on whether they were on the correct sign up form or if they finished signing up to the correct category.

However, users complained about the lack of direction on what to do next. They were dropped into a dashboard full of options but no guide on what they should do first.</li>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">For the main issue of requiring too much specific information, I first laid out the entire flow process and marked them by importance. Besides the mandatory question of personal information, I kept the questions that gave a general idea of what the user was looking for. I was able to remove half of the questions asked but still kept enough information for HealCo to categorize and create personalized dashboards and results for each user.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">With a total of five categories with similar yet different functions, it was even more necessary to create a clear division between them. Because they were similar in context, it was easier for users to confuse which flow they were going through. Before, there were only two options - Hosts and Guests. I separated them between Virtual and Physical and added a separate option for ASC. Due to ASC being a temporary option during COVID-19, it would be easier to remove later on when they are no longer necessary as an option.

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">The final issue was the lack of guidance to new users on their dashboards. I spearheaded a project called FTUE (First Time User Experience) which was a set of modals and animations that showcased the dashboard and its features in a sequential manner.

I realized the lack of connections and links between information, making the user go through the entire dashboard to find the correlation information. I included many necessary hyperlinks for users to click if they wanted more information. I also added a visual of progression so users knew how they were doing in the current flow they were in. One thing I focused on was creating a sense of flow between each feature for the users to follow through. This helped users complete each step without being lost on what they’re required to do next.

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">With the lack of necessary information and clear sense of division between different options, it gave users a confusing and frustrating user experience from start to finish. Showing a clear indication of the users category made them know they were going through the process correctly. The new form flows prevented users from leaving mid sign up because of unnecessarily complicated requests. With the new FTUE, it guided new users through their personalized dashboard which helps users use their features to the fullest. And finally with the new dashboard, it was easier than ever for users to navigate their dashboard. This smooth experience from start to finish gives users confidence in themselves and the platform that they’re using.

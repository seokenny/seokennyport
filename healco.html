                        <p class="work_box-text-para">As HealCo is still a relatively new company, most of the early focus was spent on implementing new features for users. As such, the overall designs of the general website and dashboard were left minimal and incomplete. HealCo became more known through the year and grew its user base to the point where implementing automation in its features became crucial. I was hired and tasked to redesign every existing part of HealCo as well as any new upcoming features.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">Before the increase of the user base in HealCo, every component of HealCo was kept minimal with a huge focus on implementing working features. In addition, since everything between users was done manually, it wasn’t a huge problem to have bare minimal designs; there was always a HealCo representative guiding users throughout the process.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">However as more hosts and guests signed up for HealCo’s platform, there was a need for automation. As a result of that, user experience became a big problem when there weren’t enough representatives to guide users. Having spoken to the customer success team before I began my redesign, there were sections that users (including the admins) would have confusion with.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">My main tasks were redesigning the general design and user experience for HealCo’s: website, dashboard, pillar pages, resource pages, and form flows. In addition, I would be designing any new features that were being implemented henceforth.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">The majority of the users were hosts who were looking to rent out their medically approved space, guests who were looking for medical equipment provided space, and the admins of HealCo who mediated the information and requests behind the platform. While the hosts and guests have a similar experience, I had to keep in mind the extra features that the admins would have.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">HealCo has a huge focus on telemedicine and virtual hosting and leasing. Telemedicine has been growing as COVID-19 became a bigger issue. This includes a new set of users looking for a different kind of hosting and leasing; virtual.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">I work closely with 4 other full stack engineers while I am the sole designer. The engineers have their own features they are all working on individually, but keep everyone in the loop when we have our weekly standup. I work closely with each of them to completely understand the features they are working on while also providing my mock ups and designs to get feedback.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">Having been a manual platform, HealCo was very adamant about getting user feedback. Each success team member works hard to make sure the users get from A to B in their goals while using HealCo. Using the feedback that I received, I made sure to work on the problems that seemed to really affect users, the first and foremost being the first time user onboarding experience. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">I designed an introductory guidance for new users that explained the dashboard while also providing a pseudo to-do list that they could complete at their own leisure. The introductory guide shows users the main features that they would be using, depending on host or guest. </p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">The next big issue was the sign up flows that were provided to new users before entering their dashboards. Many users were confused on what categories they fell into and whether they were going through the forms correctly. HealCo has 4 categories: Host, Guest, Virtual Host, and Virtual Guest. With the rise of COVID-19, there was also a temporary role for users hosting or leasing Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASC). However, HealCo only provided two choices for users when they signed up: Host and Guest. Data showed that some users would leave mid sign up due to the confusion. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="work_box-text-para">I made sure to create clear and independent flows for each category to prevent any room for confusion. Each flow would have its unique question while also connecting with the dashboard’s first time user experience.</p>

I worked closely with 1 full stack engineer who implemented all the features while I designed the user interface.</p>
